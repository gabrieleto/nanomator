# nanomator
A simple MonoGame script for animations

# Contributing
The script is open-source, so anyone can modify it.
Pull request will be most likely merged. Bug reports are welcome.

# Observations
The Variable `_spriteBatch` from the Game1 Class NEEDS to be public.
You only need ONE instance of the Nanomator object in you game.
